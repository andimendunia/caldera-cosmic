# Task Management Module - Implementation Summary

## Database Structure

### Tables Created
- `tsk_teams` - Teams with name, short_name (e.g., "Digitalization", "DGT")
- `tsk_projects` - Projects belonging to teams
- `tsk_items` - Individual tasks within projects
- `tsk_auths` - User permissions per team (JSON perms field)

### Key Relationships
- Teams → Projects (one-to-many)
- Projects → Tasks (one-to-many)
- Users ↔ Teams (many-to-many via tsk_auths)
- Tasks → Users (assigned_to, created_by)

### Permission System (Action-Based)
- `task-assign` - Assign tasks to other people
- `task-manage` - Create and delete tasks in any team/project (for leaders)
- `project-manage` - Create and archive project in any team (for leaders)

## Routes Structure
```
/tasks → tasks.index (landing page)
/tasks/dashboard → tasks.dashboard
/tasks/projects/* → project management
/tasks/items/* → task management (NO /create route - uses slideover)
/tasks/board → board.index (project selector)
/tasks/board/{project_id} → board.project (kanban)
/tasks/manage → manage.index
/tasks/manage/teams → team management
/tasks/manage/auths → permission management
```

## Task Creation Pattern
- **ALL task creation uses slideover** (following STC pattern)
- Component: `tasks/items/create.blade.php`
- Trigger: `x-on:click.prevent="$dispatch('open-slide-over', 'task-create'); $dispatch('task-create')"`
- Context-aware: Auto-populates project when triggered from project pages
- Redirect logic: Redirects to task list unless already on task list page

## Models
- `TskTeam` - Basic team model
- `TskProject` - Projects with status, priority, dates
- `TskItem` - Tasks with status (todo/in_progress/review/done)
- `TskAuth` - User permissions with JSON perms field

### Comment Integration
Uses existing comment system with `model_name` and `model_id`:
- Projects: `ComItem::where('model_name', 'TskProject')->where('model_id', $id)`
- Tasks: `ComItem::where('model_name', 'TskItem')->where('model_id', $id)`

## Components Created

### Navigation
- `nav-task.blade.php` - Main nav (Dasbor, Projects, Tasks)
- `nav-task-sub.blade.php` - Sub nav with back button

### Main Pages
- `tasks/index.blade.php` - Landing page (copy of projects.index)
- `tasks/dashboard/index.blade.php` - User dashboard with stats
- `tasks/projects/index.blade.php` - Project listing with filters
- `tasks/projects/create.blade.php` - Create project form
- `tasks/items/index.blade.php` - Task listing (list/board toggle)
- `tasks/items/create-slideover.blade.php` - Task creation slideover (replaces full page)

### Board Views
- `tasks/board/index.blade.php` - Project selector for boards
- `tasks/board/project.blade.php` - Kanban board for specific project

### Management Area (Following OMV Pattern)
- `tasks/manage/index.blade.php` - Management dashboard
- `tasks/manage/teams.blade.php` - Team CRUD
- `tasks/manage/auths.blade.php` - Permission management

## Key Features Implemented

### Task Status Flow
todo → in_progress → review → done

### Permission-Based UI
- Task assignment field only shows if user has `task-assign` permission
- Management area accessible to all with permission checks inside

### Integration Points
- Comment system ready (`model_name`/`model_id`)
- File upload ready (via existing com_files)
- User photos and employee IDs integrated

## Backend TODO List

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. Implement actual data loading in all components
2. Add validation and save logic to create forms
3. Create team and auth management modals
4. Implement permission checking logic
5. Add proper error handling

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Drag-and-drop for Kanban board
2. Real-time updates
3. Task assignment notifications
4. Dasbor statistics calculation
5. Search and filtering logic

### Phase 3: Polish
1. Task detail views with comments
2. Project detail views
3. Team member management
4. Activity tracking
5. Performance optimization

## Models Structure Summary

### TskTeam
```php
- id, name, short_name, desc, is_active
- Relations: tsk_projects, tsk_auths, users
```

### TskProject  
```php

- Relations: tsk_team, user, tsk_items
```

### TskItem
```php
- id, title, desc, tsk_project_id
- created_by, assigned_to
- status (todo/in_progress/review/done)
- priority, due_date, estimated_hours, actual_hours
- Relations: tsk_project, creator, assignee
```

### TskAuth
```php
- user_id, tsk_team_id, perms (JSON), role, is_active
- Relations: user, tsk_team
- Methods: hasPermission(), isLeader(), isMember()
```

## Next Steps for Backend Implementation
1. Run migrations to create tables
2. Test model relationships
3. Implement data loading in Livewire components
4. Add proper permission checks
5. Create team/auth management modals
6. Test complete workflow: team → project → task → assignment
